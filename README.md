Dagger is a collection of generic, concurrency safe datastructures.
Formerly solely a Graph library but now includes a number of additional datastructures.

    import "github.com/autom8ter/dagger"

## Features

- [x] All datastructures are concurrency safe by default
- [x] All datastructures are generic
- [x] Directed Graph datastructure
    - [x] Depth First Search
    - [x] Breadth First Search
    - [x] Topological Sort
    - [ ] Dijkstra's Algorithm (TODO)
    - [ ] A* Algorithm (TODO)
    - [ ] Tarjan's Algorithm (TODO)
- [x] Stack(T) datastructure
- [x] Queue(T) datastructure
- [x] Set(T) datastructure
- [ ] Trie(T) datastructure (TODO)
- [ ] Cache(T) datastructure (TODO)
